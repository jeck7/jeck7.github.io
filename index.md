## Introduction {#introduction}

Unit testing REST controllers is crucial for ensuring the reliability and maintainability of your Spring applications. This guide covers everything you need to know to write effective tests.

## Best Practices for Unit Testing {#best-practices}

When writing JUnit tests for REST controller methods, keep these principles in mind:

### Key Principles

- **Isolation**: A unit test should test only the controller logic, so mock all injected dependencies
- **Speed**: Unit tests should be fast - avoid database or network calls
- **Independence**: Each test should be independent and not rely on other tests
- **Simplicity**: Keep tests simple and focused on one specific behavior

### What NOT to do

- ❌ Don't use a web server (makes tests slow)
- ❌ Don't test database interactions (that's integration testing)
- ❌ Don't make tests depend on external services
- ❌ Don't test multiple behaviors in one test

## Testing with JUnit 5 and Mockito {#junit-mockito}

### Basic Setup

```java
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class UserControllerTest {
    
    @Mock
    private UserService userService;
    
    @InjectMocks
    private UserController userController;
    
    // Your test methods here
}
```

### Common Test Scenarios

1. **Testing GET endpoints**
2. **Testing POST endpoints with request bodies**
3. **Testing error handling**
4. **Testing validation**

## Testing Patterns {#testing-patterns}

### 1. Happy Path Testing
Test the successful execution of your controller methods.

### 2. Error Handling Testing
Verify that your controllers handle errors gracefully.

### 3. Validation Testing
Ensure input validation works correctly.

## Advanced Scenarios {#advanced-scenarios}

- Testing with complex request/response objects
- Testing security annotations
- Testing custom exception handlers
- Performance testing considerations
